+Gluon 2018.1.3
+==============
+
+Bugfixes
+~~~~~~~~
+
+* Fix kernel module dependency collection for external modules (`#1580 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/pull/1580>`_)
+
+  A regression in v2018.1.2 prevented the batman-adv kmod from being loaded on devices without WiFi drivers.
+
+Known issues
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)
+
+  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.
+
+* The MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)
+
+  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promicious mode is disallowed).
+
+* Inconsistent respondd API (`#522 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/522>`_)
+
+  The current API is inconsistent and will be replaced eventually. The old API will still be supported for a while.
+
+* Frequent reboots due to out-of-memory or high load due to memory pressure on weak hardware specially in larger meshes
+  (`#1243 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1243>`_)
+
+  Optimizations in Gluon 2018.1 have significantly improved memory usage.
+  There are still known bugs leading to unreasonably high load that we hope to
+  solve in future releases.
